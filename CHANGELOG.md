## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- Corrected the README configuration format list to include SARIF and clarified
  that `pnpm release:gate` is the current v0.6 compatibility and release gate.
- Refreshed the validation index and roadmap wording for the post-v0.6 release
  state.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-31

> GitHub release and tag: [v0.6.0](https://github.com/SetraTheXX/next-secure-check/releases/tag/v0.6.0). The four npm packages are published at `0.6.0`, and the reusable Action is coordinated through [v1.2.0](https://github.com/SetraTheXX/next-secure-check/releases/tag/v1.2.0) and `@v1`.

### Release

- Published the four aligned workspace packages at `0.6.0` with 25 built-in rules.
- Updated the reusable GitHub Action to `next-secure-check@0.6.0`, released it as `v1.2.0`, and coordinated the floating `@v1` tag.
- Refreshed the reproducible README demo for the published v0.6.0 CLI while keeping the concise three-scan flow.

### Documentation

- Aligned the README first-use flow, demo source wording, roadmap status, and public repository description with the published `v0.6.0` CLI and `v1.2.0` Action.
- Added the v0.6 quality gate and release-feedback validation note with a minimized five-rule matrix, opt-in smoke observations, exact version contract, and independent review handoff.
- Separated optional post-release demo and feedback follow-up from the completed v0.5 release gate.
- Documented the bounded Server Action/Server Function guard signal and its separate v0.6 identity decision.
- Documented the bounded unvalidated redirect signal, its recognized Next.js sinks, and its separate v0.6 identity decision.
- Documented the bounded SSRF source-to-sink signal, its recognized outbound HTTP sinks, and its separate v0.6 identity decision.
- Documented bounded session-cookie flag review, static Next.js header evidence, and broad image-host configuration guidance.

### Added

- Added `auth/server-action-without-guards` for direct or inline `use server` boundaries with action/request input and no visible same-function auth or input-validation intent.
- Added `redirect/unvalidated-target` for request-derived values reaching recognized redirect sinks without a visible bounded destination guard.
- Added `ssrf/unvalidated-outbound-url` for request-derived URL-like values reaching recognized server-side HTTP sinks without a visible bounded destination guard.
- Added `auth/session-cookie-without-security-flags` for recognized auth/session-like cookie writes without statically visible security flags.
- Added `config/next-image-domains` for static broad `images.domains` configuration in Next.js apps.

### Changed

- Aligned publishable package Node engine metadata with the workspace baseline of `>=20.9.0` and updated the user-facing installation guidance.
- Recognized Next.js 16 `proxy.ts` alongside legacy `middleware.ts` for bounded same-app auth and rate-limit intent signals.
- Extended API validation review signals to statically recognizable dynamic route parameters and request search parameters with bounded evidence paths.
- Kept dynamic matcher values, cross-file flow, full route reachability, and unknown wrappers outside the supported inference boundary.
- Kept the published v0.5.0 20-rule baseline available for compatibility while publishing the five bounded v0.6 rules; partial guard signals are lowered to LOW.
- Kept redirect tracking same-function and syntax-first, with recognized allowlists/internal-path checks suppressing signals and dynamic or external-looking targets remaining reviewable.
- Kept SSRF tracking server-only, same-function, syntax-first, and privacy-safe, with exact sink/source allowlists and visible host/private-network guards; the published v0.5.0 20-rule baseline remains unchanged.
- Refined `headers/missing-security-headers` to recognize static Next.js `headers()` and middleware/proxy setters, include bounded evidence, and describe dynamic/runtime uncertainty without changing its rule identity.
- Added bounded Pages Router `Set-Cookie` serializer and CommonJS `next.config.cjs` discovery coverage without expanding the published baseline.
- Kept the published v0.5.0 20-rule baseline unchanged while the published v0.6.0 line contains 25 rules.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-29

> GitHub release and tag: [v0.5.0](https://github.com/SetraTheXX/next-secure-check/releases/tag/v0.5.0), targeting the validated release commit. The four npm packages are published at `0.5.0`, and the reusable Action is coordinated through [v1.1.0](https://github.com/SetraTheXX/next-secure-check/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and `@v1`; post-release feedback remains follow-up work.

### Added
- Published the v0.5 release line with the root composite GitHub Action pinned to the available `next-secure-check@0.5.0` package.
- Added a CI smoke step that exercises the local Action against the secure fixture.
- Added an opt-in terminal-only `--summary` view for concise score, risk, finding-count, severity, confidence, context, and location output.
- Added shared syntax-only bounded-flow facts for direct sources, command sinks, guards, short aliases, invalidations, function boundaries, and proven evidence paths.
- Added the first raw SQL bounded source-to-sink slice for recognized query sinks, SQL-valued local aliases, dynamic string concatenation, and optional source evidence paths.
- Added structural auth, route-handler, and rate-limit intent signals for App Router, Pages Router, and same-app middleware checks.
- Added the v0.5 regression/performance release gate for fixture inventories, deterministic reports, concise summaries, public-output privacy, benchmarks, and CLI pack dry-runs.
- Added bounded finding explanations to detailed terminal, Markdown, GitHub, and web exports, including `Why`, context reason, and proven `evidencePath` metadata.

### Changed
- Refined `xss/dangerously-set-inner-html` with a documented sanitizer allowlist and bounded evidence paths for direct request-derived values.
- Refined authentication and validation rules so UI paths, comments, strings, unused helpers, and unknown local wrappers do not silently suppress endpoint findings.
- Extended `explain <rule-id>` with explicit false-negative boundaries for bounded flow, dynamic resolution, and external controls; SARIF now exposes the normalized `whyReported` property while preserving existing identities and fingerprints.

### Documentation
- Added the reproducible VHS README demo, simplified SVG wordmark, and v0.5 summary-output validation note.
- Added the v0.5 baseline/finding-identity inventory and bounded-flow contract decision note for issue #13.
- Added the shared `AnalysisFacts` foundation validation note for issue #14.
- Added the raw SQL bounded-flow validation note for issue #15, including intentional stop conditions and a directional performance sample.
- Added the Phase 13 validation note with the repeatable 100/1,000-file cold/warm benchmark protocol and release-gate evidence.
- Added the Phase 14 XSS source/sanitizer refinement validation note for issue #16.
- Added the Phase 15 auth/middleware intent validation note for issue #17.
- Added the Phase 16 evidence and reporter explanation validation note for issue #18.

### Fixed
- Removed the Windows `shell: true` release-gate invocation so package dry-runs no longer emit Node's shell-spawn deprecation warning.
- Fixed direct route-parameter command sources so they populate the shared bounded-flow source facts as well as the existing evidence path.
- Fixed raw SQL bounded-flow aliases being dropped after a recognized query sink, so repeated sink uses remain visible.
- Fixed static raw SQL concatenation with primitive literals being classified as dynamic interpolation.
- Fixed secret finding evidence leaking through CLI JSON, terminal, and Markdown reports; public reporter output now uses `[REDACTED]`.
- Fixed unknown XSS sanitizer wrappers being silently treated as safe.
- Fixed login/register rules treating UI filenames and rate-limit-looking text as endpoint protection.
- Fixed API/upload rules missing route-root and Pages Router variants, and API helper files being treated as endpoints.
- Fixed auth/rate-limit intent from unrelated helpers, generic role-property reads, unbound or incorrectly aliased `auth` imports, and partially protected multi-handler route files.

### Tests
- Current validation baseline: 366 package tests, 147 web tests, 513 total tests.
- Dependency audit is clean after pinning the test-only Vite peer to patched `8.0.16`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-24

### Documentation
- Clarified that v0.4.0 is published and removed stale release-candidate wording from the CLI package documentation.
- Updated npm-facing usage guidance for reproducible v0.4 scans and the v0.4.1 CLI documentation patch.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- Prepared a reproducible fixture-first demo flow for v0.4 release review; external repositories remain optional smoke-test inputs rather than accuracy claims.
- Clarified `secrets/next-public-secret` wording as a review signal based on a secret-like name, not proof that the assigned value is a credential.
- Added guidance for intentionally public client identifiers and more descriptive `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` names.
- Refined auth and API validation intent detection to ignore comments and keyword-only identifiers while recognizing common auth and validation calls.
- Added shared `AnalysisFacts` syntax parsing with a per-scan source-file cache.
- Added a bounded same-function command source-to-sink pilot with optional JSON/SARIF `evidencePath` metadata.
- Raised the supported Node.js baseline to Node 20 and aligned CLI metadata with `commander@14`.
- Upgraded the web demo and secure fixture to Next.js 16.3.2 and added a warning-free ESLint gate.
- Made workspace tests resolve package source instead of potentially stale `dist` output.
- Added the lint gate to CI and included the MIT license text in every published package tarball.
- Updated generated and documented GitHub workflows to current Node 24-based action majors while keeping scanned projects on Node.js 20.

### Fixed
- Kept password findings active when a hashing dependency is installed but not actually used.
- Corrected monorepo Next.js project/router detection and avoided treating generic `src/api` directories as Next.js.
- Scoped nested app middleware signals so they protect only routes in the same app.
- Aggregated SARIF rule metadata using the strongest effective severity and confidence for each rule.
- Mapped GitHub API rate limits safely and prevented rejected distributed-concurrency requests from consuming IP rate quota.
- Removed duplicated hardcoded CLI version literals by reading the package manifest at runtime.

### Tests
- v0.4.0 release validation snapshot: 320 package tests, 146 web tests, 466 total tests.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- Benchmark/regression fixture suite for representative monorepo, registry, tooling, XSS, SQL, password, admin, upload, and config cases.
- Middleware auth and rate-limit signals from `middleware.ts` and `src/middleware.ts`.
- CLI `rules` command for listing built-in deterministic rules.
- CLI `explain <rule-id>` command for terminal rule explanations.
- CLI `init` command for generating a starter `.next-secure-check.json` and GitHub Actions workflow.

### Changed
- Reduced `unknown` context classifications for registry, story, demo, playground, fixture, and package UI paths.
- Refined `xss/dangerously-set-inner-html` sanitizer and source signals.
- Refined login/register rate-limit detection for route-level and middleware-level limiter signals.
- Improved SARIF rule metadata with help URIs, tags, selected CWE mappings, security severity, and deterministic fingerprints.

### Fixed/Improved
- Preserved vulnerable fixture coverage while reducing false-positive/noise cases in synthetic real-world-style fixtures.
- Kept app/default/ci preset behavior stable while improving context classification.
- Kept SARIF secret/evidence redaction behavior intact.
- Raised the validation baseline to 429 passing tests.

### Notes
- v0.3.0 keeps the same core CLI scan surface while improving analysis quality and CLI usability.
- Findings remain deterministic review signals, not proof of exploitation.
- Full type-aware analysis and a larger route graph remain future work beyond the v0.3 release.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-24

### Documentation
- Clarified recommended `npx --yes next-secure-check@latest` usage for local scans.
- Added reproducible `next-secure-check@0.2.0` examples for CI workflows.
- Documented how to diagnose and remove stale global installs that can shadow v0.2 CLI options.
- Added copy-paste GitHub Actions examples for Step Summary and SARIF / GitHub Code Scanning.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- Context metadata and context reasons on findings.
- `--preset` CLI option for `default`, `app`, `strict`, `ci`, `audit`, `library`, and `monorepo` scan modes.
- `preset` config option in `.next-secure-check.json`.
- Context-aware severity and confidence tuning.
- AST-assisted `injection/command-exec` detection.
- AST-assisted `injection/raw-sql-concat` detection.
- AST-assisted `xss/dangerously-set-inner-html` detection.
- AST-assisted `auth/password-without-hashing-library` detection.
- Route-aware `auth/admin-route-without-auth` detection.
- Endpoint-aware upload validation checks.
- Context-aware `config/next-powered-by-header` refinement.

### Changed
- Reduced noisy findings in large monorepos, template-heavy repositories, and tooling-heavy repositories.
- Improved shadcn/ui benchmark from roughly 166+ noisy findings to 55 default / 47 app findings.
- Improved create-t3-app app preset benchmark from 13 findings to 8 findings.
- Reporter output now includes finding context in user-facing formats.
- JSON and SARIF outputs now include context metadata.
- Added app-focused scan guidance for large repositories and monorepos.
- Clarified that findings are review signals, not proof of exploitation.

### Notes
- Findings are review signals, not a full security audit.
- False positives and false negatives are still possible.
- Full type-aware analysis was intentionally deferred beyond the v0.2 release.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- CLI scanner for local Next.js project scans.
- 20 deterministic security rules across secrets, injection, XSS, auth, config, headers, upload, and validation categories.
- Terminal, JSON, Markdown, GitHub Actions Summary, and SARIF 2.1.0 report formats.
- SARIF metadata, deterministic partial fingerprints, and concise result messages for GitHub Code Scanning usage.
- `.next-secure-check.json` config support for `excludePaths`, `categories`, `failOn`, and `format`.
- CLI flags for `--exclude`, `--category`, `--fail-on`, `--format`, `--output`, and `--config`.
- Public GitHub repository web demo with JSON and Markdown export.
- Safe tarball extraction with path traversal, symlink, hardlink, duplicate path, size, and file count protections.
- Server-side secret evidence redaction for web scan responses.
- Optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` support for GitHub metadata and tarball requests.
- Optional Upstash Redis REST distributed scan abuse guard.
- GitHub request and scan-stage timeout handling.
- Safe minimal logging and error responses for public scan operations.
- Package README files for npm tarball presentation.
- NPM publish readiness metadata for the CLI, core, rules, and reporter packages.

### Fixed
- `--fail-on critical` now gates on critical scan summary risk level.
- Command execution matching no longer ignores real bare calls after safe method calls on the same line.
- Low-signal hardcoded secret sample values produce fewer false positives.
- Raw SQL logging/error-message contexts produce fewer false positives.
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` severity is context-aware for static literals versus user-controlled-looking values.
- Committed environment file detection now covers common `.env.*` variants.
- Missing security header detection now reports partial header configurations.
- Successful web scans are preserved when immediate cleanup fails, with a safe cleanup warning.

### Security
- Web demo avoids executing scanned repository scripts.
- Web responses and safe logs avoid raw secrets, tokens, local paths, and stack traces.
- Client IP resolution validates IPv4/IPv6 values and handles oversized headers safely.
