const RULE_EXPLANATIONS: Record<string, RuleExplanation> = {
  "xss/dangerously-set-inner-html": {
    checks: "Flags dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage when the HTML source is not clearly static or sanitized.",
    why: "Rendering user-controlled HTML can lead to cross-site scripting in Next.js pages and components.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Static HTML strings, sanitizer calls, and component/template contexts may be lower risk.",
    falseNegativeNote: "Cross-file values, dynamic component resolution, and custom sanitizer wrappers are not fully proven; a clean result does not prove every rendered HTML value is safe."
  },
  "auth/admin-route-without-auth": {
    checks: "Looks for admin-like API route handlers without local or middleware auth signals.",
    why: "Admin endpoints usually expose privileged data or actions and should require authentication and authorization.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Middleware, framework conventions, or external gateways can protect a route even when the handler is minimal.",
    falseNegativeNote: "The check does not build a full cross-file middleware or authorization graph; custom wrappers and external gateways may be missed."
  },
  "auth/server-action-without-guards": {
    checks: "Looks for direct Server Actions or Server Functions with a use server directive and action/request input but no visible auth or input-validation intent.",
    why: "Next.js Server Actions are public request boundaries and should re-authorize the caller and validate client-controlled input.",
    falsePositiveNote: "A guard in a shared data-access layer, framework adapter, or unknown local wrapper may be valid but is not proven by this syntax-only check; one recognized guard lowers the finding.",
    falseNegativeNote: "The check does not prove runtime reachability or follow cross-file calls, dynamic exports, or custom wrappers; it only inspects the same function and short local aliases."
  },
  "redirect/unvalidated-target": {
    checks: "Looks for request-derived values reaching imported redirect, permanentRedirect, NextResponse.redirect, or Pages Router getServerSideProps destinations without a recognized path or host guard.",
    why: "An unvalidated redirect destination can send users to an attacker-controlled location or create a phishing/open-redirect path.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Fixed destinations, explicit internal-path checks, host/origin allowlists, and deployment controls can make a flow safe even when the surrounding syntax needs review.",
    falseNegativeNote: "The check is intentionally bounded to recognized same-function sources, sinks, and short aliases; custom wrappers, cross-file/cross-function flow, dynamic properties, and unsupported router/config APIs are not proven."
  },
  "ssrf/unvalidated-outbound-url": {
    checks: "Looks for request-derived URL-like values reaching global fetch or exact-import axios/got HTTP sinks in exported server handlers without a visible host allowlist, URL guard, private-network rejection, or safe proxy helper.",
    why: "Server-side requests to attacker-controlled URLs can reach internal services or metadata endpoints and create a server-side request forgery path.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Fixed URLs, static host allowlists, and visible same-file URL or private-network guards can be safe; middleware, proxy, or infrastructure controls outside the file are not proven.",
    falseNegativeNote: "The check is intentionally bounded to same-file server entries, known sinks, URL-like request fields, and at most two aliases; cross-file/cross-function flow, dynamic sinks, unknown wrappers, DNS/network probing, and other request fields are outside the boundary."
  },
  "auth/login-without-rate-limit": {
    checks: "Looks for login/auth routes without route-level or matching middleware rate-limit signals.",
    why: "Authentication endpoints are common brute-force and credential-stuffing targets.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Infrastructure-level rate limiting may not be visible to a static source scan.",
    falseNegativeNote: "The check does not build a full cross-file middleware or infrastructure graph; custom rate-limit wrappers and external controls may be missed."
  },
  "auth/register-without-rate-limit": {
    checks: "Looks for register/signup routes without route-level or matching middleware rate-limit signals.",
    why: "Registration endpoints can be abused for spam accounts or resource exhaustion.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Infrastructure-level abuse controls may not be visible to a static source scan.",
    falseNegativeNote: "The check does not build a full cross-file middleware or infrastructure graph; custom abuse-control wrappers and external controls may be missed."
  },
  "injection/command-exec": {
    checks: "Flags child_process imports and calls such as exec, execSync, spawn, and spawnSync.",
    why: "Shell command execution can become command injection when arguments are user-controlled.",
    falsePositiveNote: "CLI/release tooling can legitimately execute commands; presets/context tuning reduce that noise.",
    falseNegativeNote: "Bounded source-to-sink flow is limited to the same function and a small alias chain; cross-file, cross-function, and dynamically resolved execution paths may be missed."
  },
  "injection/raw-sql-concat": {
    checks: "Flags interpolated SQL templates passed to common query sinks.",
    why: "Interpolated SQL can expose applications to SQL injection.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Static or parameterized queries are intentionally ignored.",
    falseNegativeNote: "Bounded source-to-sink flow is limited to the same function and at most two alias hops; cross-file, cross-function, and dynamically constructed query paths may be missed."
  },
  "secrets/hardcoded-secret": {
    checks: "Looks for high-signal hardcoded API keys, tokens, passwords, and provider token patterns.",
    why: "Committed secrets can be copied, leaked, and abused after publication.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Obvious sample values are filtered, but rotate any real token that was committed.",
    falseNegativeNote: "Pattern matching does not cover every dynamically assembled or externally injected credential; a clean result is not a complete secret inventory."
  },
  "secrets/next-public-secret": {
    checks: "Flags NEXT_PUBLIC_ variable names containing secret-like terms; it does not prove that the assigned value is a credential.",
    why: "NEXT_PUBLIC_ values are exposed to browser-side code in Next.js, so credential-like values deserve review before shipping.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Public client identifiers or browser-safe tokens can be intentional. Review the assigned value and audience, and rename the variable when practical.",
    falseNegativeNote: "The rule is name- and context-based; secrets hidden behind computed names or other configuration channels may be missed."
  },
  "headers/missing-security-headers": {
    checks: "Looks for missing common security header configuration in recognized Next.js headers() and middleware/proxy header setters.",
    why: "Security headers help reduce XSS, clickjacking, content sniffing, and referrer leakage risks.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Headers configured outside the app, dynamic values, or framework adapters may be valid even when this bounded syntax check reports a gap.",
    falseNegativeNote: "The check does not evaluate runtime header values or headers configured by reverse proxies, hosting, or dynamic framework code."
  },
  "auth/session-cookie-without-security-flags": {
    checks: "Looks for recognized auth/session-like cookies written through cookies().set, response.cookies.set, or a bounded Pages Router Set-Cookie serializer without visible httpOnly, secure, and sameSite flags.",
    why: "Session cookies need deliberate browser and transport protections to reduce script access and accidental cross-site transmission.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Only auth/session-like cookie names are considered, and dynamic options remain low-confidence review signals; some intentional cross-site flows may require a different sameSite policy.",
    falseNegativeNote: "The check does not resolve custom cookie wrappers, dynamic names, cross-file helpers, runtime TLS/browser behavior, or cookie writes through unsupported APIs."
  },
  "config/next-image-domains": {
    checks: "Looks for static host entries under images.domains in a Next.js config.",
    why: "The broad images.domains form does not constrain protocol, port, or pathname as precisely as remotePatterns.",
    falsePositiveNote: "A deliberately broad image host may be acceptable for a specific deployment; review the allowed origins and replace it when narrower constraints are possible.",
    falseNegativeNote: "Dynamic config, computed objects, and runtime image-host policy are not resolved; remotePatterns are recognized as the constrained alternative."
  },
  "upload/missing-file-type-validation": {
    checks: "Looks for upload route handlers without file type validation signals.",
    why: "Uploads without type validation can allow unsafe file handling or unexpected content.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Deep validation in shared helpers may not always be visible.",
    falseNegativeNote: "Validation implemented through shared helpers, middleware, or infrastructure may be missed."
  },
  "upload/missing-file-size-limit": {
    checks: "Looks for upload route handlers without file size limit signals.",
    why: "Uploads without size limits can cause resource exhaustion.",
    falsePositiveNote: "Limits enforced by hosting or middleware may not be visible.",
    falseNegativeNote: "Limits enforced through shared helpers, middleware, hosting, or infrastructure may be missed."
